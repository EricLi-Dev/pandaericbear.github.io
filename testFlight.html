  <h1 id="about">About</h1>
<div class="line">
  </div>
  <p id="about-text">Test of Flight is a Top-Down video game. In the beginning, you will start with no abilities, but as you progress and kill enemies, you have the chance to find a number of  "ability blocks." As you explore the map, you will find weapons that will give you the edge over your enemies. As you upgrade your character, enemies will progressively be harder to defeat.
  </p>

  <h1 id="story">Story</h1>
<div class="line2">
  </div>
  <p id="story-text">Gideon Jones (the main character), a  was sent by the Sicarius Empire to finally put an end to the Petra Ruinas Rebels. Nobody has ever returned from Petra Ruinas alive. Legend has it that the island is protected by the gods, and is covered by an invisibility dome. A local fisherman was the first to find the island, but the location is never the same: "You can't find it, it finds you." When you arrive at the island, you were struck by an unknown force which made you lose the ability to move. You quickly learn how to walk, but that's about as far as you get. It is your mission to wipe out the Petra Ruinas rebels and return back.

  </div>
  <p id="items-text">Ability blocks are found randomly around the map that rewards you with points. After obtaining a certain amount of points you unlock abilities. These abilities help you on each level.
